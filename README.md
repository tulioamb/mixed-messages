Node Javascript Git
## Code Description
The message to be generated is composed of three parts. Each of them comes from predefined arrays. In order for the message to make sense, the arrays are divided into: who, what, when. The method `Math.random()` is used to randomly pick the message parts.
## Launch
To run this program, execute the following commando in the terminal: `node script.js`.
## Purpose
This program itself is a quite simple one, but is playing a major role in my Full-Stack Engineer Path. I am practicing important concepts concerning Javascript programming, Markdown and control version using Git and GitHub.
